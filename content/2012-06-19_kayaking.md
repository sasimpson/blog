Title: Got a kayak

I really wanted to get on to the water this summer and spend some time floating around.  Didn't really want to get a jet ski, because I don't want to pull it behind my car.  Didn't want to get a sailboat or catamaran for pretty much the same reason.  Ended up getting a Hobie Mirage Outback kayak.  It's a really nice little boat.  One of the nice features is you can pedal it instead of paddle.  I also got the sail kit which makes it a small sailboat too.  

Texas has some paddling trails which I'm hoping to explore this summer.  I've had the kayak out twice and it's a great boat.  The sail gets me going about as fast as pedaling.  The combo really moves.
