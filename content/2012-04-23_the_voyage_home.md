We're heading out after the LAX meetup.  Next stop is Denver.  Damn this RV is buuuuumpy.  I had a good time visiting my buddy Art. It was his birthday this weekend and we went out and threw it down hard.  Really nice meeting his kids for the first time.  Sho has a great arm for a three year old.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in the majors.  Rai is independent and quiet.  Looks just like Art.  It was also real good seeing Arnold, Simon, Bolo and Art's buddes again.  I need to make it a point to get out there more often.  Had some pretty sweet Japanese food on Saturday and awesome Korean food on Sunday.
