Title: Back on the Bike

Trying to get back on my bike.  I've setup my trainer in one of my extra rooms with a TV and the Roku.  Trying to ride for at least a hour a day, then hope to get to an hour in the morning and night.  I think with that and eating less I can get down to where I'm "supposed" to weigh.  So far 222lbs is the lowest I've gotten down to.
