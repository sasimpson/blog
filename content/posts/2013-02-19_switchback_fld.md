I got a Harley a few months ago.  Trying to ride when I can.  Going for nice
long rides in the Hill Country is easy from Boerne, provided the weather stays
nice.  I got a 2013 HD Switchback FLD.  Nice part about the Switchback is that
it comes with both hard bags and a windshield which are removable.  

Here is the bike with the gear on:

and with the bags off:

I've changed out all the lighting with LED so that it's brighter and clearer.
