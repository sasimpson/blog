A friend of mine pointed out [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for hosting static content.  I checked them out and shortly after creating my account, I was able to get this blog built, hosted, and added Let's Encrypt SSL capability that I did not have before. No need to really set anything up except transfer the DNS to Netlify.  It took less than a minute to get it setup, and another five minutes DNS transferred and done.  Seriously impressive, and now running my blog!
