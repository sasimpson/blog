My Twitter handle is @scotty.  for some reason people think if you put a @ in front of a name, like @Scotty McCreery, its going to go to @ScottyMcCreery.  That's because those people are idiots.  Those all go to me.  Also, maybe people should look up with the real twitter handle is.  Perhaps people should be smarter than a bowl of soup.  I think I might be asking a lot though.

*sigh*
