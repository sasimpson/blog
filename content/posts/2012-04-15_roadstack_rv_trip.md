Well we made it.  29 hours of driving through El Paso, Phoenix, LA and to San Francisco.  I'm exhausted but it was a great trip.  We had a pretty good vision of what we wanted to do.  I don't think we did as much work as we initially envisioned.  The Clear modem didn't work for most of the trip and our cell coverage was pretty spotty.  I drove through a pretty gnarly sandstorm outside El Paso, the steering wheel was at a 45&deg; angle or more due to the wind.  Sleeping was kind of rough.  It's hard to sleep when you're bouncing around due to 60mph gusts.  We made it thought, with plenty of Red Bull and Monster.
