Is this thing on?

I'm fairly sure no one acutally reads this blog, or maybe some people do when and if I post it as a "website".  It went from some ranting stuff to posting technical things related to my job.  I have not been at that job for almost 2 years now, which is probably reflected in the fact I have not updated anything in a while.  I do need to realign this to be more related to some of my personal projects again.  

Things I want to post about soon:

* I've been building a K8S cluster for a while using Raspberry Pis, would be nice to get some of my findings and experiments down here.
* Fly tying?
* My woodworking projects?
* Rants about cool or not cool things I find in the areas I work in?

Stay tuned
