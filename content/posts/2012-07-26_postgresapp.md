<a href="http://postgresapp.com">Very cool</a>.  Download, launch, done.  It is super simple and hopefully will get some people wanting to use PostgreSQL more.  It has a default db of your userid, no password.  Set your app to localhost/<userid> for dev work.  You can create new dbs pretty easily.  Much easier than installing MySQL.  The real trick was getting psycopg2 installed.  Once I updated xcode and installed the commandline apps through xcode it worked like a champ.
