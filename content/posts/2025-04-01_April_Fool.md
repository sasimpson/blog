My journey through employment has been quite long, and at times, I think that I'm still figuring it out. Last year was 25 years of professional software development for me, fifteen in management positions. And while I've been a manager, I haven't stopped understanding and learning about technology, programming, participating, challenging myself some. The last few leadership roles have really made me think seriously about work and who you work with. And even my last development role was problematic at the end, with a situation where I was actively being targeted and it made me want to leave. I think it's a situation that people should know about, and how do you handle it when your manager is making up things to try to manage you out of your role. As someone who had been a manager, I was more prepared to handle that situation than most were and I wasn't the only one who had to deal with it.

My last two jobs have really burned me out on leadership and management in general. I've wanted to get back to a place where I can be a full time developer again, as I really enjoy creating things. I enjoy being a leader, but I'm not interested in playing games and being political. I want to have a career that involves my successes and skills not how well I can schmooze the right people. 

I started working for a large retail company in 2019. I was hired to be a senior software engineering manager, a role I've one a few times before. I started with a largish team, had another team added to my workload, and had to create an entirely new team to work on 3D stuff. It was a lot of responsibility, definitely something a senior manager could handle for a reasonable amount of time. Three years I did that. I asked to get a manager hired to take one of my teams, not even working for me, just to get someone to focus on the needs of that team. The large, old, retail company that I was working for had many people that had been there for 15-20 or more years.  Many relationships form in that amount of time, relationships that go between different levels of careers. I understand how that all works, as I've been in a similar situation being one of the people that had been around a while at Rackspace. 

I was given the chance to join one of my teams, working on 3D tools, as a Staff Software Engineer.  I wasn't sure when that happend if I had the chops to be at that level, but I quickly realized that I did, and do. I was able to successfully lead multiple levels of our projects with some amount of success. 

Since I was no longer a manager, someone had to take my place. We spent two months interviewing people until we hired a new manager to take my old job.  Lets call her Lana. Lana took over my old teams, having been an employee of the company for over twenty years. Very little of this was in management, leadership, or even technology, but she interviewed well and my old boss gave her the role. And for a while, she was a good partner in getting stuff done. We communicated almost every day, I would  escalate concerns and share the teams successes. Since she had my old role, she did not have managers for the teams and relied on me to effectively lead the team.
