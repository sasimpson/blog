My journey through employment has been quite long, and at times, I think that I'm still figuring it out. Last year was 25 years of professional software development for me, fifteen in management positions. And while I've been a manager, I haven't stopped understanding and learning about technology, programming, participating, challenging myself some. The last few leadership roles have really made me think seriously about work and who you work with. And even my last development role was problematic at the end, with a situation where I was actively being targeted and it made me want to leave. I think it's a situation that people should know about, and how do you handle it when your manager is making up things to try to manage you out of your role. As someone who had been a manager, I was more prepared to handle that situation than most were and I wasn't the only one who had to deal with it.
