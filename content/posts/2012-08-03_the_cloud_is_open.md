The cloud is open.  Rackspace announced it's open cloud on Wednesday.  Essentially CloudServers is now running off Nova, part of Openstack.  CloudFiles, which is an implementation of Swift, has been for a while now.

What I'm really enjoying about it, is we now have a whole suite of products to go with Servers and Files.  Database as a Service (DBaaS) means you don't have to run MySQL on your Server.  The new [mycloud.rackspace.com](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) interface is really easy to use and clean.  I recently had to setup a forum for someone and I was done setting up a server, dbaas and 2 dbs in 10 minutes.
