I am a software development leader that still enjoys playing with different technologies.  I love to ski, fish, camping, hiking, and kayaking.  I'm a amateur extra class radio operator and enjoy digital modes over the radio.  I have two little girls and a lovely wife, and we live outside San Antonio, TX.  

Places I have lived:

* Northern California
* Southern California
* Texas
* Virgina
* New York
* Washington
* The Netherlands
