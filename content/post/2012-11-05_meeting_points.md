I hate meetings.  Some are necessary, most are not.  What I've noticed is that
 certain people will just start adding people to meetings and then the meeting
has 20+ people in it.  There is no way to negatively reenforce that they are
doing something bad, especially when 17-18 of those people are just sitting
there staring at the wall.  The other situation is the 2-3+ hour meeting that
doesn't really accomplish anything.  Giving people a short meeting time causes
people to work things out quickly and take less important and off task issues
outside of the meeting.  So my proposal is Meeting Points.

Meeting Points is a work in progress, but here is what I've been thinking about:

* Everyone gets a certain amount of meeting points a month (lets say, 1 a day for the month...30)
* For each 30 minutes of a meeting you schedule, you have to pay 1 meeting point.

Pretty simple!  But the idea of meeting points isn't to just limit people who
schedule too many long meetings, it's to punish them!  Penalties are where the
 fun kicks in.

* Meetings over an hour, 1.5x meeting point penalty. (2 hour meeting costs 6 meeting points)
* Meetings over 6 people costs 1 point per person over
* Meetings after 5pm cost 2x meeting points.
* Meetings after 4pm on friday cost 3x meeting points.
* Meetings during lunch or lunch meetings cost 2x meeting points.

Okay now we're in business.  "Wait! I'm really important and I need to schedule
 a lot of meetings! How do I get more points?!"  Well, you can buy points from
other people who don't schedule lots of important meetings.  People like
developers and engineers will have a ton, since they don't schedule a ton of
meetings.  You may have to make a deal to get those points.  Also be careful
how many useless meetings you schedule them for, they may not want to sell
their points to someone who makes them sit around for hours when they could be
getting work done.

update
------
few people have given me some more ideas.  I think that if you schedule a
meeting and it only runs for 1/2 the allotted time you should get back some of
your meeting points.  30 min meeting under 15 minutes, all back.  Hour meeting
under 30 mins, get 1/2 back.
