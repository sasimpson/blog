I've been at Rackspace for six years.  I don't think I've stayed anywhere for that long.  I spent the first five working in IT, at first as a developer, then the last year as a development manager.  Then a little over a year ago I got the opportunity to move to CloudFiles as the engineering manager.  I love where I'm at and my team is hella smart and easy to get along with.  

Here's to another year.
