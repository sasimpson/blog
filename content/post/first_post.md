i hope to add some of my old posts in once posterous decides to release them.  i'm going to use static generated pages from now on.

i'm going to the openstack summit on saturday.  we are traveling via RV from San Antonio to San Francisco in one straight haul there.  we should arrive on sunday and the conference is the whole week.  we are going to take our time returning, going through LA, Denver, Dallas and Austin, meeting up with users and developers. i'm going to be the Swift guy on the trip. should be fun.

you can follow us on [twitter](http://twitter.com/roadstackrv) and my [personal twitter](http://twitter.com/scotty).
