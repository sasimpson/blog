Happy New Year!  While I'm not going to make resolutions this year I'm going to try and do better on some things.  Playing with my new ham radio has made me want to tinker with electronics more this year.  I'd like to try and build a small arduino based weather station.  Sparkfun has a nice kit for that.  Also, I'd like to challenge myself in the kitchen.  I have *four* Thomas Keller cookbooks now and I need to make some stuff in those!
